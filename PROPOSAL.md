# Project Proposal

For the 126 final project, I am going to build a Rubic's Cube playground. In the playground a user will be able to play with a 3D Rubic's Cube using only their mouse or keyboard. The playground will use OpenGL for both the graphics rendering, animation, and mouse and keyboard interactions. 

## Tasks Break Down 

* **Checkpoint 1**
  * Build a single manipulable cube and a Cube API
  * Using Cube API, build up a mouse library to pan the screen and rotate the cube 
  * Build out a 3x3 rubic's cube with a Rubic's Cube API
* **Checkpoint 2**
  * Using the Rubic's Cube API add mouse controls to rotate individual sides of the cube so the user can try to solve the cube.
  * Check to see if the cube is solved.
* **Checkpoint 3 **
  * Using the Rubic's Cube API build a scrambling feature so the cube can be mixed up after a user has solved the cube.
  * Also build a timer into the app so a user can time themselves solving the cube.
* **Other Potential Features If Time Permits**
  * Using the Rubic's cube API build auto solver feature that sovles the cube on its own.
  * Add a feature that can give a user help when solving the Rubic's Cube or even teach user's how to solve the cube.
